  This guide is going to get you up and running with Assembly Coins. In three easy steps we'll show you how to create your own App Coin from scratch, Send some to a friend, and finally keep track of them on the Blockchain.

<h2 id="issue-a-new-coin">1. Issue a new App Coin</h2>

<p>
  To start, you'll want to declare some information about your App Coin for posterity. All App Coin metadata will be encoded on the Bitcoin Blockchain, with the exception of your email address. Your <code>email</code> is used to notify you when the App Coin has been created on the Blockchain and is ready for transfer.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/colors/prepare \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "issued_amount": 10000000,
    "description": "Karefully Krafted Koin for Kats",
    "coin_name": "KatKoins",
    "email": "kris@example.com"
      }'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This will return a response like looks like:
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "minting_fee": "0.00054808",
  "issuing_public_address": "1MRuSdYzMHmifxw7FwpYpzcoPDRm2J5VLv",
  "issuing_private_key": "PRIVATE KEY HERE",
  "name": "KatKoins"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  You now need to send the <code>minting_fee</code> amount in BTC to the <code>issuing_public_address</code>. The mining fee scales with the amount of content you put in the description for the App Coin. For the example above, you would need to send 0.0004 BTC to <code>1EmnqhfvjcAdA71gs2exugXkgHrJw9QcuA</code>. The issuing address will be the official public address where all of your App Coins must originate.
</p>

<p>
  After sending Bitcoin to this address, a series of transactions will be written for you by the API. These transactions will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a multipart statement on the Bitcoin Blockchain declaring your intent to form a new App Coin.</li>
  <li>Write an Open Assets issuing transaction back to the issuing address. You'll use this to transfer existing coins later.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Send the <code>minting_fee</code> from an existing Bitcoin wallet you own. Afterwards you'll receive an email that your new App Coin now lives on the blockchain!
</p>



<h2 id="transfer-coins-to-your-wallet">2. Transfer the App Coins to another address</h2>

<p>
  You have full control over the issuing address because you were given a private key in step 1. Let's now transfer some of your App Coins to a wallet your friend controls. This transactions will be signed by the Assembly Coins API.
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/transactions/transfer
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-X POST
-d '{
  "from_public_address": "1MRuSdYzMHmifxw7FwpYpzcoPDRm2J5VLv",
  "from_private_key": "PRIVATE KEY HERE",
  "transfer_amount": 44,
  "to_public_address": "173CJ9wxuZFbJyDbkJ89AfpAkqx5PatxMk",
  "source_address": "1MRuSdYzMHmifxw7FwpYpzcoPDRm2J5VLv",
  "fee_each": 5e-05
  }'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  The <code>from_public_address</code> &amp; <code>from_private_key</code> are the address and private key of the issuing address from step 1. For this initial transfer, the <code>source_address</code> is also the <code>from_public_address</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This command queues the transaction to be processed. It can take several minutes to be fully recognized by the blockchain. The command will return immediately but if you specify the <code>callback_url</code> parameter, you will receive a JSON POST with more specific transaction hash information once the transaction has been processed.
</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
{"result": "Queued"}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Callback Response</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "transaction_hash":"18812f3e2eebb3a267afd54b8b8c54a8a2a7afe719ec4c5c19342c42793bb52a"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Once that transaction has processed your friend will be the proud owner of 10 Kat Koins!
</p>

<h2 id="check-your-coin-balance">3. Check your App Coin balance</h2>

<p>
  Now for the easy part. Lets inspect your wallet and see what App Coins it contains:
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl https://coins.assembly.com/v1/addresses/1BHjGfCcEY1uJMJsHRJDXBdSeo5SbqcHcz
{% endhighlight %}

Your response:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "public_address": "1BHjGfCcEY1uJMJsHRJDXBdSeo5SbqcHcz",
  "assets": [
              {
                "quantity": 10,
                "color_address": "3N5CbL5qHbu1P2oBEaVsFJ4R1n3UxsV1o3"
              }
            ]
}
{% endhighlight %}
